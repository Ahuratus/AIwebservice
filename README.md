# Trajectory Detection Web services
## Description
This project is a lightweight web-service providing [trajectory estimation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-92957-4_28) *API* for users.
Nowadays, Trajectory estimation and detection as a fundamental means to robotics and  autonomus vehicles technology is in demand of the market of this industry. Thus we decided to develop a web service which can provide a lightweight, responsive web-service for [autonomous vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_vehicle) and [IoT-devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things).
